# ðŸš„ Deploy PME2GO to Railway

Railway is the **recommended free hosting** for PME2GO because it provides:
- Free PostgreSQL database
- Docker support
- Automatic deployments from Git
- $5/month free credits (sufficient for small apps)

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

```bash
# Make sure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

**Option A: One-Click Deploy**
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/lmgM1H)

**Option B: Manual Setup**

1. **Sign up**: Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub
2. **Create new project**: Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Select repository**: Choose your PME2GO repository
4. **Add database**: Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

```env

REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
JWT_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
```

Railway will automatically provide:
